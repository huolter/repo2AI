# repo2AI  ðŸ’» -> ðŸ¤– 

This script downloads a GitHub repository as a ZIP file, extracts its contents, and generates a detailed structure and content description output in Markdown format to be used in AI applications, in particular with LLMs, when you want to include the context of a complete repository. 

The output includes a hierarchical folder structure and the content of each file in the repository.

## Features

- Download and Extract: Automatically downloads and extracts the entire repository for offline inspection.
- Structure Description: Provides a detailed hierarchical view of the directory structure.
- Content Description: Extracts and outputs the content of each file, attempting to detect and display the programming language when applicable.

## Usage

Clone this repository and navigate to the directory. Run the script using the following command:

python repo2ai.py [repo_url]

- Replace [repo_url] with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to analyze.
- If no URL is provided, the script defaults to analyzing the repository: https://github.com/karpathy/cryptos/.
- You can edit the default repo URL at the top of the script

## Output

- The script generates an output.txt file in the script's directory.
- This file contains a Markdown-formatted description of the directory structure and the contents of each file within the repository.

## Notes

- The script uses the requests library to download the repository. If not already installed, you can add it using:

  pip install requests

- The script will overwrite the output.txt file each time it is run.
- See the repo folder and output.txt as examples based on https://github.com/karpathy/cryptos/
